# UniC
### _Feel at Home, Away from Home_
Applying to colleges is a huge pain for students all over the world, and especially when they are applying to college abroad. Our app UniC, which stands for University Connect, helps to fix this through a variety of features.

## Problem and Solution
Students who go abroad to study often find it difficult to connect with their family, friends and culture back home. Additionally, they find it tough to manage student loans, bank accounts, air travel fares, food, part-time jobs and studies - the fact that each of these have their own separate apps makes it even tougher than it already is. Our app attempts to solve that problem, by bringing all these features onto one platform.


But that's not all. We also provide a platform for prospect students who wish to travel abroad for their studies to connect with career counsellors from different companies, as well as with other students on the app who are studying abroad.

## The Main Features

### Student Marketplace
Users on the app can buy and sell items through the app. Need a textbook for your calculus class? Someone must be selling it here.

### Mentorship Features
Users can sign up as "mentors" on the app, allowing other users to seek them out and contact them about any advice they may need. Not sure whether to add a Business minor to your CS major? Ask someone!

### Career Counselling Feature _(not yet available)_
We are planning to partner with a number of career counselling companies, such as Crimson Education and Coaching 4 Good, whose counsellors can reach out to users on our app(or vice versa) for career/education-related advice. Additionally, this app will provide a platform for Freelancers to reach out to an audience of users. On our side, we will conduct qualification and background checks on any freelancers who wish to use the app, to ensure that students and parents alike have a satisfactory experience.

### Food and Merch _(not yet available)_
Some Food and Merch companies(especially small local businesses) will be enlisted to sell their wares to students on our app.

### Finances _(not yet available)_
We wish to partner with banks, mobile companies, and airline companies so that we can offer them discounted rates on student loans, mobile plans, and flight tickets, making it much more comfortable for them to make the shift and move abroad. Already we have communicated with a number of companies, and they will be willing to look at possible partnerships if our app has a stable userbase.

## The Impact
Our app will help provide cheaper services to students, solving the problems of millions of parents and students worldwide, and will positively impact universities as well since more students will be comfortable with the idea of studying abroad, away from their homes.
